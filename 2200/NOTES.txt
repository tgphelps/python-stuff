disk header - sectors 0-3
SCF control record - 4-7
VOL1 - 8-11

version 0 or 1 prep??

Example from SOS:
drep,r dr1,1000,REM001

From Ward:
Both SOS and ROS use 512-byte blocks to store every 4 sectors of information.
There are no unused bits between words on disk  That leaves 12 unused bytes
per physical "record" but it is much cleaner from a performance standpoint
to begin every transfer at an actual block boundary.  It has been pointed
out to me that Unisys was incredibly fortunate to have designed the original
"fastrand" format as 28 words of 36 bits per sector because it makes such
optimal utilization of modern hardware.

Another item of interest is that a real, physical 2200 disk does nothing
with the first two records.  Perhaps these are reserved for hardware.
But PS/2200 uses the first record for labeling and identification.
The second record on a ROS disk is used to save the SCF settings
(DRS pack only).  The disk format is so compatible in fact that it is
possible to transfer a ROS VD image to a physical disk and use it on a
real 2200 system.  At least I think so.

Diskedit commands:

g <sector>
d <offset> <count>
fdata
ascii

go n:
    get_sector n
    print 'sector n'

dump offset count:
    end = offset + count - 1
    if end <= 28-1:
        dump_words offset count
    else:
        dump_words offset count_to_end
        while more to dump
            go sector
            dump from 0 to end or done

get_sector n:
    if necessary
        read_disk n / 4 * 4
    return index of first word

dump_words start count: (all in one sector)
