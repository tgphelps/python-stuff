The git repository for this is in /home/tgphelps/tsm-oravm.
The make file installs into /root/tsm-oravm

Programs we need:
	Mount a repository
	Refresh inventory for a repository
	Backup some or all VMs
	List VMs needing backup

All programs will be Python modules, which may call shell scripts.

When we backup a VM, backup its vm.cfg file as well as its disks.

Should we use sqlite3 to store data? Think about it.

The vm.cfg file appears to be legal Python code. Maybe we eval()
some or all of it.

Must configure TSM for subfile backups. See wiki for notes.

Query for VM disk backups:
    dsmc query backup '/repos/*/VirtualDisks/*' [ -ina ]
    dsmc q b '/repos/' -subdir=yes (?)
